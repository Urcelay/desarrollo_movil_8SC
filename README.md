Welcome to Flutter Login App, a simple yet eye-catching mobile application developed with Flutter.
It features an interactive login screen with Rive animations and a user-friendly design.

Flutter is a framework for building mobile, web, and desktop applications created by Google. It allows developers to create cross-platform native apps using a single programming language, Dart, offering fast development, beautiful UI, and high performance thanks to its own rendering engine.

Rive is a tool that allows creating interactive real-time animations for applications. The State Machine in Rive lets you control animations based on user interaction—for example, making a bear look happy or sad depending on whether the password is correct.
